Recursion for while loop?

While loop! The reason is that we should aviod recursion in engineering project (stack overflow!)
Though it may be easlier, don't use recursion. 
If we can use while loop, use it. 


Some features in question:
1: First/Last of something


Some key points in binary search

1: start = 0   end = len(num) - 1  while start + 1 < end

So once it jumps out of the loop, start == end or start + 1 == end
And it can also help handle first position

2: middle = start + (end - start)/2

3: A[middle] > < == target

4: Check A[start] and A[end] in the end
